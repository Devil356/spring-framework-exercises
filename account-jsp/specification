Product MVC app

Create new maven project with all required dependencies, plugins and configs

Create a Product model with the following fields
-   id
-   name
-   price

Create a ProductService backed by HashMap. Implement the following methods
-   save - receives a new Product, assigns an id to it and stores it in the map by id
-   getById -  receives an id, and returns a Product found in map by id

Configure Spring MVC application, including servlet initializer, view resolver and other required beans

Create ProductController that has the following methods:
-   getProduct - handles GET request to “/products” with id parameters,
    uses ProductService to find a Product and passes it to the view account.jsp
-   getProductForm - handles GET request to “/products/add” and forwards it to the productForm.jsp
-   saveProduct - handles POST request to “/products” that contains form parameters,
    receives a Product created from form parameters and stores new product using ProductService

Create JSP pages
-   product.jsp
-   productForm.jsp

* Implement additional functionality that allows to see the whole list of existing products
(one more jsp view, one more controller method, one more service method)

** Implement navigation between pages.
E.g. page that show one account should contain a button(or link) that allows to see all products,
and another button that allows to add new product.
A page that shows the list should provide some navigation to each product.
E.g. a product name can be clickable. When you click on product name it goes to its page (using get by id).
A product form should have two buttons. E.g. “Save” and “See all”

*** Implement validation and notification.
When new product is stored, a message “Product has been stored successfully” should be printed below the button “Save”.
If the product with a current name already exists, an error message should be displayed
